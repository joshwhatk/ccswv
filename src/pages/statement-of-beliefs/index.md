## “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit…” Matthew 28:19

### The Word of God

We accept and believe the doctrines of historic, Bible-believing Christianity. We receive these not as dead articles of religion which have little meaning or relevance for our time, but as vital truths based upon the Word of God.

### The Trinity

We believe in the Godhead, the Holy Trinity, in which there are three persons of one substance, power and eternity – the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

### God the Father

We believe in God the Father Almighty. He is a God of love, mercy, justice and holiness.

### Jesus Christ

We believe in Jesus Christ, who was God and man; His virgin birth, His sinless life, His substitutionary and redeeming death, and His physical resurrection.

### The Holy Spirit

We believe in the Holy Spirit who executes the Word of God in the Church and in the world.

### The New Birth

We believe that every person must surrender to the Lordship of Jesus Christ and be born of the Holy Spirit before he is a Christian.

### Sanctification

We believe in entire sanctification, subsequent to regeneration, whereby the believer is cleansed from the pollution of sin, saved from its power, and enabled through grace to love God with all his heart.

### A Holy Life

We believe that every Christian is ordered to live a holy life- one that merits the name “Christian.”

### Sacraments

We believe in two sacraments-Baptism and Holy Communion. The mode of baptism is left to the conscience of the individual.

### Resurrection

We believe in the resurrection of all bodies to be judged and receive their due rewards.

### Eternal Life

We believe in eternal life for the redeemed and eternal punishment for the unbelieving and lost.

### The Church

We believe in the Church, local and universal, and that God is in her midst.

### The Lord’s Return

We believe in the literal return of Jesus Christ to receive His bride, the Church.
